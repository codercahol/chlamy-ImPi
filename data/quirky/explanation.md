The files included in this folder were taken prior to the official start of the HT Chlamy screen and were used to develop the experimental design and software pipeline for the main screen.

As a result, they don't obey the same general structure and each file has a unique content.

The contents of the different files are as follows:

- "Fluc light CC125.tif": this is a very early photo taken of identical WT cells and the plate is entirely full (no blank in the corner). (verify)
- "20230918 plate positions test.tif": idr exactly, but I think this is a blank plate and it was taken out and put back in in the middle of the run
- "20230920 light curve 384 wtf.tif": Light curve using wild type F. Light curve means that we didn't exactly get the normal Fv/Fm photos. I think the light intensity increases gradually with each pair of photos(?)
- "20230915 15min-15min BLANK TEST.tif": A blank test to calibrate the amount of reflected/background light
- "blank dark light dark new calibration.tif": Another blank for calibration, I don't remember exactly how it was different
- "WT dark light dark new calibration.tif": A plate full of WTF for calibration, I don't remember exactly how it was different
